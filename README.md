# Instructions
Create a Quotes Randomizer using Pairs and Randoms. The following requirements must be met:

- Three types of Quotes with 10 quotes each
- Each type of quotes must have its own Helper Class using Companion Objects
- Use save preference to save a favourite quote with a timestamp 
- The main screen should show a randomize quote every time the app starts
- There must be 4 buttons in the main screen (3 types of quotes and show fave quote button)
- Screen/Activity for the Fave Quote
- Screen/Activity for the random quotes

Bonus:

- If the random quotes activity is only one activity and not per type of quote
- If the button will have a text icon
- If the fave quotes button is disabled when there is no saved fave quotes yet and will be enabled once there is a saved quote (TIP: Use the Activity Lifecycle)
- If the app is well designed and the code is organized
